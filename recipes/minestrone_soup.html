       <strong>ahansen's Review</strong>, "Wow. What a big soup indeed. Not only did my husband offer the unprovoked, "this is the best soup I've ever had," there were clean bowls at the end of the meal- four of them. The significance? My children ate vegetables- and liked it. First of all, I'm one of these cooks that shamefully can't leave well enough alone and cannot, will not, has not, ever left a recipe as is. It's not in my genes. Graciously, Chef John gives us all creative license in his video to waver from the recipe and I did. So, let me tell you what I changed, mostly due to what I had on hand and wanted to use up, and also because I'm pretty sure I was in the wrong grocery store to find "cranberry beans." I used frozen chopped onions- (I know, but it's what I had) two 14 oz cans diced tomatoes, 1 can small white navy beans in lieu of the cranberries, and a large bunch of romaine lettuce instead of swiss chard and cabbage. I refused to pay $4.99 for the chard and I forgot to buy the cabbage. I did throw in about a half cut of large carrot dices that held up well, and fresh green beans cut into 1/2 in pieces. Lovely. That being said, everything else I left untouched- except- I did cut a bit of the parm rind and throw it in while it simmered- awesome call. It was amazing. We had a beautiful loaf of three cheese garlic bread from our local bakery to dredge up the beautiful sauce between hearty bites. I will be placing this recipe in my PERMANENT collection, and you should too."

        <strong>Sue's Review</strong>, "This is a very good, hearty soup, even with all my changes, which I made based on product availability and our particular preferences. I substituted a cup of diced ham for the pancetta, a handful of chopped baby spinach for the swiss chard, a 19 oz. can of kidney beans for the cranberry beans, 2 cups of packaged chopped cole slaw mix for the chopped cabbage, and freshly grated parmesan cheese for the cheese called for. I taste tested throughout the cooking process and added seasonings as needed. Unfortunately, my canned tomatoes were bitter and acidic so I had to add about 2 teaspoons of sugar and 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda about the end of the cook time to get rid of that taste. Oh, and I also cut back on the water and chicken broth by about one cup each because I prefer a thicker base.In spite of everything, it was pretty darned good, making enough soup for about 6 adult size servings. I did spend a lot of time hovering and stirring because it does thicken as it cooks. Served it with homemade dinner rolls, cole slaw, and fresh sliced pears. This soup is another All Recipes keeper."
