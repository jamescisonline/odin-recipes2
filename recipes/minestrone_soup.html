        <strong>Sandy's Review</strong>, "What can you say about a Chef John recipe except once again he nailed it. I made this soup last night and made it as written and it was so good. We both loved it. The only thing I did was to add more liquid as the cooking ended. Next time I will simply add it in the beginning because it really did need it but I will make this many times over again. It was just plain pefect."
