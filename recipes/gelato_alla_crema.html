        Answering the question "What would vanilla ice cream taste like without any vanilla?," Italian "crema" ice cream (gelato alla crema) is exceptionally delicious not because of what's in it, but rather what isn't. Ironically, it might be the best vanilla ice cream I've ever had. Without any other flavors in the way, all you taste is the sweet goodness of milk and cream, which I think is a revelation.

        <strong>Jackie's Review</strong>, "Best ice cream recipe I’ve found!! Made it many times now. Freezes nice with wonderful “scoop ability”. I have also had fun with a few tweaks. I used brown sugar to deepen the color and give it a bit of a caramel flavor. Then I added Heath Toffee baking bits. Nummm! I also made a batch with mint extract and added little Andes mint baking bits. Just be sure to continue to stir while cooking the mixture. I have had no problems. Oh, one more thing, I just use all Half and Half because that’s all I have In my refrigerator( and it makes things simpler)."
